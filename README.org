* About

This repo contains a few utilities intented to practice *nix programming. It also contains the
source files for the book "Advanced Unix Programming", for easy access.

*** SharedLibs.org
This is an org babel literate program. The program itself doesn't do much of anything, it just
creates a shared library and then loads it at runtime. What's useful is that it's written in a
literate programming style; by tangling and executing some of the embedded commands, it'll produce a
full functioning program. The nicely formatted/rendered documentation then serves as future
reference.

*** copy.c

Simple ~cp~ like program for copying the contents of one file to another

*** fell.c
A basic *nix shell, like bash
*** sdl.c
Testing out some SDL stuff
